# Workbench Attachments

Here are custom attachments for the pegboard on a Scandinavian [Probuilder Workbench](https://www.obsbygg.no/verktoy-og-tilbehor/oppbevaring/2800435).
This particular peg structure does not seem very common, but the attachments may potentially be reusable on other tool wall by changing the peg definition.

Most of the model have pegs directly on the build plate.
Organic supports works nicely for off-the-ground (and especially stacked) pegs.
Using support enforcers on only the round parts of the pegs (i.e. bridge across spacing) makes stable pegs that require minimal effort to detach the supports.

## Bits

Note that all of these are usually a bit tight in my prints, since they extrude straight out (or even slightly tilted downward from their weight).
I prefer that rather than having them fall out.
